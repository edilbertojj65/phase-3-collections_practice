# Build a method sort_array_asc that takes in an array of integers 
# and returns a copy of the array with the integers in ascending order.

def sort_array_asc(array)
    array.sort
end

# Build a method sort_array_desc that takes in an array of integers and returns a copy of the array with the 
# integers in descending order. Remember that .sort takes a block in which you can specify how you want your array sorted

def sort_array_desc(array)
    array.sort do |a, b|
        b <=> a
    end
end

# Build a method sort_array_char_count that takes in an array of strings and returns a copy of the array with the 
# strings ordered in ascending order by length. Remember that .sort takes a block in which you can specify how you 
# want your array sorted.

def sort_array_char_count(array)
    array.sort do |a , b|
        a.length <=> b.length
    end
end

# Build a method swap_elements that takes in an array and swaps the second and third elements. Remember that array indices start at 0, so the second element has an index of 1 and the third element has an index of 2.

# Advanced: Try building a method swap_elements_from_to that takes in three arguments, array, index, destination_index, that will allow you to specify the index of the element you would like to move to a new index. So:

# swap_elements_from_to(["a", "b", "c"],0,2) #=> ["c", "b", "a"]
# swap_elements_from_to(["a", "b", "c"],2,1) #=> ["a", "c", "b"]
def swap_elements(array)
    array[1], array[2] = array[2], array[1]
    array
  end

#   Build a method reverse_array that takes in an array of integers and returns a copy of the array with the 
#   elements in reverse order

def reverse_array(array)
    array.reverse
  end

  #Build a method called kesha_maker that takes in an array of strings and replaces the third character in each
  #string with a $ ("dollar sign")â€”Ke$ha style. Use the .each method to iterate and build a new array to return
  #at the end of your method, just like we did in the "My Each" lab.

  def kesha_maker(array)
    array.each do |item|
      item[2] = "$"
    end
  end

  #Build a method find_a that returns all the strings in the array passed to it that start_with? (hint) the letter
  #"a". You'll want to use a high level iterator for this that finds, selects, or detects elements based on a
  #condition

  def find_a(array)
    array.find_all do |word|
      word[0] == "a"
    end
end

# Build a method sum_array that adds together all of the integers in the array and returns their sum.

# Advanced: Try using the .inject method here.
def sum_array(array)
    sum = 0
    array.each do |num|
      sum+=num
    end
    sum
  
    # using reduce method
      # array.reduce(:+)
  
    # using inject method (short)
       # array.inject(:+)
  
    # using inject method (long)
       # array.inject do |sum,x|
       #  sum + x
       # end
  end

#   Build a method that adds an "s" to each word in the array except for the second element in the array ("feet" is already plural).

# Advanced: Iterators in Ruby are chainable, see if you can use .each_with_index in addition to .collect to solve this one in an elegant way. What happens if you write:

# [1,2].each_with_index.collect{|element, index| } 

def add_s(array)
    array.collect do |word|
      if array[1] == word
        word
      else
        word + "s"
      end
    end
  end
